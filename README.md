# Duelyst Mods
> A curated mod library for Duelyst. WIP

## Usage

See https://github.com/duelyst-mods/mod-loader for instructions on loading mods.

## Contributing

File an issue! Create a PR! Ping me in the [Duelyst discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/0WbpmyLbu52aphyb) (although I'm usually AFK).

### Adding your mod

Create a PR:

* Add one or more mod `.js` files in the [mods](mods) directory.
* Update [mods.json](mods.json) with your mod info. The top-level key is the basename of the mod script file. The rest is arbitrary.
